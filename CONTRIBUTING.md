# How to Contribute

We're so thankful you're considering contributing to an [open source project of
the U.S. government](https://code.gov/)! If you're unsure about anything, just
ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is
you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate all friendly
contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its
[LICENSE](LICENSE), and its [README](README.md).

## Getting Started

Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` for good opportunities to contribute. These issues are specifically chosen to help newcomers get involved with the project.

### Team Specific Guidelines

- Please try to keep pull requests to a reasonable size; try to split large contributions to multiple PRs
- Document and explain the contribution clearly according to provided standards when possible.
- Feel free to reach out to us if there is any confusion. A list of the project maintainers is found here: [COMMUNITY.md](./COMMUNITY.md)

### Building dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:
- [super-changelog](https://github.com/DSACMS/super-changelog)
- [OpenSSF Criticality Score Python Library v1.0.7](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score/releases/tag/v1.0.7)
- [empty-repos](https://github.com/github/empty-repos) GitHub Action

To build the dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) for `main.py`, run
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> criticality-score v1.0.7 and PyGitHub 1.54.0 are pinned for compatibility between the two libraries. We are currently using a deprecated version of the criticality score library, which uses an older version of PyGitHub. We plan to upgrade and use the latest version of the criticality-score library soon.

The GitHub CLI can be used to run and test the action locally.

### Building the Project

N/A. Users can simply fork/clone the repo, reference the GitHub Actions in their workflows, or run the python and subaction scripts directly.

### Workflow and Branching

We follow the [GitHub Flow Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

1.  Fork the project
2.  Check out the `main` branch
3.  Create a feature branch
4.  Write code and tests for your change
5.  From your branch, make a pull request against `DSACMS/archival-identifier/dev`
6.  Work with repo maintainers to get your change reviewed
7.  Wait for your change to be pulled into `DSACMS/archival-identifier/dev`
8.  Delete your feature branch

### Testing Conventions

<!-- TODO: Write tests -->
TBD

### Coding Style and Linters

<!-- TODO: Implement linters -->
TBD

### Writing Issues

When creating an issue please try to adhere to the following format:

    module-name: One line summary of the issue (less than 72 characters)

    ### Expected behavior

    As concisely as possible, describe the expected behavior.

    ### Actual behavior

    As concisely as possible, describe the observed behavior.

    ### Steps to reproduce the behavior

    List all relevant steps to reproduce the observed behavior.

### Writing Pull Requests

Comments should be formatted to a width no greater than 80 columns.

Files should be exempt of trailing spaces.

We adhere to a specific format for commit messages. Please write your commit
messages along these guidelines. Please keep the line width no greater than 80
columns (You can use `fmt -n -p -w 80` to accomplish this).

    module-name: One line description of your change (less than 72 characters)

    Problem

    Explain the context and why you're making that change.  What is the problem
    you're trying to solve? In some cases there is not a problem and this can be
    thought of being the motivation for your change.

    Solution

    Describe the modifications you've done.

    Result

    What will change as a result of your pull request? Note that sometimes this
    section is unnecessary because it is self-explanatory based on the solution.

Some important notes regarding the summary line:

* Describe what was done; not the result
* Use the active voice
* Use the present tense
* Capitalize properly
* Do not end in a period — this is a title/subject
* Prefix the subject with its scope

## Reviewing Pull Requests

When you submit a pull request on GitHub, it will be reviewed by the project community, and once the changes are approved, your commits will be brought into a development branch for additional testing. Once the changes are merged, they will be pushed back to the main branch.

If the issue the pull request is addressing is particularly urgent, the pull request will be merged directly into the main branch.

## Shipping Releases

archival-identifier will see regular updates and new releases. This section describes the general guidelines around how and when a new release is cut.

### Versioning

archival-identifier uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Each release is associated with a [`git tag`](github.com/DSACMS/archival-identifier/tags) of the form `X.Y.Z`.

Given a version number in the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (eg., `X.Y.Z`) format, here are the differences in these terms:

- **MAJOR** version - make breaking/incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version - add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- **PATCH** version - make backwards compatible bug fixes

### Breaking vs. non-breaking changes

Breaking changes for archival-identifier include modifications that affect how the action is consumed in workflows, such as:
- Renaming or removing action inputs or outputs
- Changing default behaviors that would alter existing workflows
- Modifying the structure or format of generated content (issues, PRs, README notices) that downstream automation may depend on

Non-breaking changes include bug fixes, new optional features, documentation updates, and internal refactoring that doesn't affect the action's interface.

#### Ongoing version support

The following versions of the project are actively supported:
- TBD

### Release Process

The sections below define the release process itself, including timeline, roles, and communication best practices.

#### Goals

Our release structure aims to deliver value to users through:

- Ensuring the action consistently performs repository archival tasks
- Delivering new features and functionality based on our product roadmap
- Providing bug fixes
- Keeping documentation up-to-date with new features
- Incorporating feedback and contributions from external collaborators
- Addressing vulnerabilities through hotfix releases when necessary

#### Schedule

We follow a feature-based release schedule where new versions are released upon completion of features on the project roadmap rather than on a fixed time-based cadence. This approach ensures that each release delivers meaningful functionality and has been properly tested.

Release timing will depend on:
- Completion and testing of roadmap features
- Community feedback and prioritization
- Complexity and scope of changes

For special cases such as security updates or critical bugfixes, hotfix releases will be made immediately as needed, independent of the feature release schedule.

#### Communication and Workflow

We will notify users about new releases through the following channels:
- #cms-ospo slack channel for agency communications
- #wg-ospo CHAOSS slack channel for the greater OSPO community

<!-- TODO: (OPTIONAL) Support beta feature testing
## Beta Features

When a new beta feature is created for a release, make sure to create a new Issue with a '[Feature Name] - Beta [X.X.x] - Feedback' title and a 'beta' label. Update the spec text for the beta feature with 'Beta feature: Yes (as of X.X.x). Leave feedback' with a link to the new feature Issue.

Once an item is moved out of beta, close its Issue and change the text to say 'Beta feature: No (as of X.X.x)'.

### Preparing a Release Candidate

The following steps outline the process to prepare a Release Candidate of archival-identifier. This process makes public the intention and contents of an upcoming release, while allowing work on the next release to continue as usual in `dev`.

1. Create a _Release branch_ from the tip of `dev` named `release-x.y.z`, where `x.y.z` is the intended version of the release. This branch will be used to prepare the Release Candidate. For example, to prepare a Release Candidate for `0.5.0`:

   ```bash
   git fetch
   git checkout origin/dev
   git checkout -b release-0.5.0
   git push -u origin release-0.5.0
   ```

   Changes generated by the steps below should be committed to this branch later.

2. Create a tag like `x.y.z-rcN` for this Release Candidate. For example, for the first `0.5.0` Release Candidate:

   ```bash
   git fetch
   git checkout origin/release-0.5.0
   git tag 0.5.0-rc1
   git push --tags
   ```

3. Publish a [pre-Release in GitHub](https://github.com/DSACMS/archival-identifier/releases/new):

   ```md
   Tag version: [tag you just pushed]
   Target: [release branch]
   Release title: [X.Y.Z Release Candidate N]
   Description: [copy in ReleaseNotes.md created earlier]
   This is a pre-release: Check
   ```

4. Open a Pull Request to `main` from the release branch (eg. `0.5.0-rc1`). This pull request is where review comments and feedback will be collected.

5. Conduct Review of the Pull Request that was opened.

#### Incorporating feedback from review

The review process may result in changes being necessary to the release candidate.

For example, if the second Release Candidate for `0.5.0` is being prepared, after committing necessary changes, create a tag on the tip of the release branch like `0.5.0-rc2` and make a new [GitHub pre-Release](https://github.com/DSACMS/archival-identifier/releases/new) from there:

```bash
git fetch
git checkout origin/release-0.5.0
# more commits per OMF review
git tag 0.5.0-rc2
git push --tags
```

Repeat as-needed for subsequent Release Candidates. Note the release branch will be pushed to `dev` at key points in the approval process to ensure the community is working with the latest code.

### Making a Release

The following steps describe how to make an approved [Release Candidate](#preparing-a-release-candidate) an official release of archival-identifier:

1. **Approved**. Ensure review has been completed and approval granted.

2. **Main**. Merge the Pull Request created during the Release Candidate process to `main` to make the release official.

3. **Dev**. Open a Pull Request from the release branch to `dev`. Merge this PR to ensure any changes to the Release Candidate during the review process make their way back into `dev`.

4. **Release**. Publish a [Release in GitHub](https://github.com/DSACMS/archival-identifier/releases/new) with the following information

   - Tag version: [X.Y.Z] (note this will create the tag for the `main` branch code when you publish the release)
   - Target: main
   - Release title: [X.Y.Z]
   - Description: copy in Release Notes created earlier
   - This is a pre-release: DO NOT check

5. **Branch**. Finally, keep the release branch and don't delete it. This allows easy access to a browsable spec.

### Auto Changelog

The [auto-changelog.yml](./.github/workflows/auto-changelog.yml) workflow will be used to update CHANGELOG.md. This provided workflow will be triggered when a new release is created, automatically populate the CHANGELOG.md with all of the associated changes created since the last release that are included in the current release.

### Hotfix Releases

In rare cases, a hotfix for a prior release may be required out-of-phase with the normal release cycle. For example, if a critical bug is discovered in the `0.3.x` line after `0.4.0` has already been released.

1. Create a _Support branch_ from the tag in `main` at which the hotfix is needed. For example if the bug was discovered in `0.3.2`, create a branch from this tag:

   ```bash
   git fetch
   git checkout 0.3.2
   git checkout -b 0.3.x
   git push -u origin 0.3.x
   ```

2. Merge (or commit directly) the hotfix work into this branch.

3. Tag the support branch with the hotfix version. For example if `0.3.2` is the version being hotfixed:

   ```bash
   git fetch
   git checkout 0.3.x
   git tag 0.3.3
   git push --tags
   ```

4. Create a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/DSACMS/archival-identifier/releases/new) from this tag and the support branch. For example if `0.3.3` is the new hotfix version:

   ```md
   Tag version: 0.3.3
   Target: 0.3.x
   Release title: 0.3.3
   Description: [copy in ReleaseNotes created earlier]
   This is a pre-release: DO NOT check
   ```
